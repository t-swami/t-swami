- 👋 Hi, I’m Talla Narayana Swami
- 👀 I’m interested in VLSI mainly in the domain of Digital Design and Verification
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Front-End Digital Design and verification Languages from Cadence.
- 💞️ Here I had a plan to post a code for certain number of days related to the VLSI.
   Most probably I will post every day, but may not for 1 dayin a month.
